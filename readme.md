## Style Guide
This is my first style guide with multiple colot schemes for a from end (public) and back end (private) sections.

### Installation

Requirements:
  + PHP

  + [composer][composer]

  + [NodeJs][nodejs]

  + [bower][bower]


In a terminal type:
```
$ bower i
$ composer install
```

[nodejs]: https://nodejs.org
[composer]: https://getcomposer.org
[bower]: http://bower.io

### Run it

#### Php webserver

You can run ``php -S localhost:85`` (as 85 the port, change it to your needs)
, then go to ``http://localhost:85`` (or the port you changed, if so), to see
the homepage.

To see the styleguide page, go to ``http://localhost:85/styleguide``.
